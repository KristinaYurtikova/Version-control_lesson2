## Bold and italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after a word or phrase. For example, *this is italicized* or _this is italicized_.

To bold text, add two asterisks (**) or underscores (_ _) before and after a word or phrase. For example, **this is bold** or __this is bold__

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. For example, 
This text is ***really important*** or this text is ___really important___. This is really***very***important text. 



## Lists


To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. For example, 
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Forth item

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. For example, 
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3



## Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. For example, ![Hello, it's a cat](Cat.jfif)

## Links

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. For example, this is the *[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)*

For relative links, use just the braskets and parentheses. For example, [About us](/about)

To create mailto links, add your text in braskets, followed by mailto + email address text in parentheses. For example, [Contact us](mailto:admin@jetbrains.com)

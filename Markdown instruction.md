## Bold and italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after a word or phrase. For example, *this is italicized* or _this is italicized_.

To bold text, add two asterisks (**) or underscores (_ _) before and after a word or phrase. For example, **this is bold** or __this is bold__

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. For example, 
This text is ***really important*** or this text is ___really important___. This is really***very***important text.

## Bold and italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after a word or phrase. For example, *this is italicized* or _this is italicized_.

To bold text, add two asterisks (**) or underscores (_ _) before and after a word or phrase. For example, **this is bold** or __this is bold__

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters. For example, 
This text is ***really important*** or this text is ___really important___. This is really***very***important text. 



## Lists

## Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL. For example, ![Hello, it's a cat](Cat.jfif)
